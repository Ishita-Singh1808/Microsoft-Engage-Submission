## Features

### Work Flow followed in the development of this project: -

1. Selecting Problem statement. ( Problem Statement is selected from the list of problems given in the problem statement section )
2. doing initial analysis of the problem statement. ( learned the required skills for Developing the solution )
3. Designing the UI/UX. ( Figma is used for designing the UI/UX )
4. Developing the UI/UX. ( making ejs files for the UI/UX )
5. Developing the backend. ( using NodeJs )
6. Testing the backend.



### What is sorting 
Sorting refers to ordering data in an increasing or decreasing fashion according to some linear relationship among the data items

### Various sorting algorithms
1. bubble sort
2. selection sort
3. insertion sort
4. merge sort
5. quick sort
6. heap sort
7. radix sort
8. counting sort
9. bucket sort

### what are the best sorting algorithm among the one mentioned
    Quicksort and merge sort are the best sorting algorithms with having some drawbacks of their own like in case of quicksort, it is not stable, in case of merge sort, it is stable but it is not in-place sorting algorithm.

### what is ment by in place sorting algorithm
    In-place sorting algorithm is a sorting algorithm that does not require any additional memory space to sort the data.
### what is ment by stable sorting algorithm
    Stable sorting algorithm is a sorting algorithm that maintains the relative order of the elements that are equal.


### time complexity of quick sort
- Worst case: O(n^2)
- Average case: O(n log n)
- Best case: O(n log n)
### time complexity of merge sort
- Worst case: O(n log n)
- Average case: O(n log n)
- Best case: O(n log n)

    So since in web based applications   the available memory is limited, which  we cannot afford to lose it that's why  merge sort isn't used even if it's a stable algorithm. so we have to use quick sort. mainly because  it is in-place, i.e. it does not need extra memory when sorting a huge list, and  it performs great on average.




### Technologies Used ( in order of occurance of usage)

1. Figma ( For designing the UI/UX)
2. Vs Code ( As Text Editor ).
3. Numerous Vs Code Extensions ( For Easing Up the Development Work like identation management, debugging, etc.)
4. Git ( For Version Control ).
5. Github ( For Version Control ).
6. Web Development Languages ( HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)
7. backend development languages ( Vanila JavaScript etc.)
8. Database ( MongoDB, etc.)
9. Web Servers ( Node.js, Express, etc.)
10. NodeJs Modules ( like express, mongoose,Passport, ejs etc.)
11 Embedded JavaScript (ejs).
12. RESTAPI ( Restful API )
13. Authentication ( Passport )
14. Cloudinary ( For Images And Video Uploading ).
15. dotenv ( For Storing the API Keys ).
16. Other Technologies ( like JQuery, Bootstrap, etc.)






## Installation

GadgetFreak requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd MicroSoft-Engage-Solution
npm i
node app.js
```
### Creating An User Before Seeding Objects Into Database
```sh
Go To 127.0.0.1:9483/Register
Create An User
```
### Updating Author I'D In The Seed File
```sh
Open Seeds/index.js
on Line 15 Add Your Own user object id from MongoDb
then on terminal 
node seeds/index.js to seed products into local database
```


Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:9483 or At http://localhost:9483/
```
